# Checkers
A multiplayer checkers game using Java RMI and JavaFX. The [client](src/main/java/Client) handles player queues, board display, and move highlighting when hovering over a piece. Each player can select their preferred color before the game starts. The [server](src/main/java/Server) manages communication between two clients and handles game logic. The game begins once two clients with different preferred colors are connected to the server.
